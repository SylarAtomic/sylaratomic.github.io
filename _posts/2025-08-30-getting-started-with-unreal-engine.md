# Getting Started with Unreal Engine 5

This is a collection of Game Dev notes I've made along my journey. I hope they provide you with some good knowledge. I'll try to keep this updated the best I can.

## Start with Blueprints

If you are starting out with Unreal Engine, **start with Blueprints**. Please don't get sucked into the whole Blueprint vs C++ debate. It should never be looked at as Blueprint vs C++ but rather **Blueprints AND C++**. Best practice dictates using them both. 

> **Important:** You can release games with Blueprints only! 

Take a look at these examples:
- **Born of Bread** - A Paper Mario-inspired RPG made entirely with Blueprints
- **CIRCULATION** - A puzzle-platformer built primarily with Blueprints  
- Many indie games being released on Steam using Blueprint-only workflows

So when starting out, start with Blueprints, figure out how to use them and what their role is.

## My Learning Recommendations

### 1. Start with Blueprints
[Game Dev TV's Blueprint Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealblueprint/) on Udemy is fantastic for getting you up and running with the engine. They keep their courses updated with each new engine version.

### 2. Add C++ Later
If you feel you want to explore the C++ side, and get a better understanding of how to use Blueprints WITH C++, check out [Game Dev TV's C++ Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/). It goes over all the basics.
